Any two-level quantum-mechanical system can be used as a qubit. Multilevel
systems can be used as well, if they possess two states that can be effectively
decoupled from the rest (e.g., ground state and first excited state of a
nonlinear oscillator). There are various proposals. Several physical
implementations that approximate two-level systems to various degrees were
successfully realized. Similarly to a classical bit where the state of a
transistor in a processor, the magnetization of a surface in a hard disk and
the presence of current in a cable can all be used to represent bits in the
same computer, an eventual quantum computer is likely to use various
combinations of qubits in its design.

All physical implementations are affected by noise. The so-called T1 lifetime
and T2 dephasing time are a time to characterize the physical implementation
and represent their sensitivity to noise. A higher time does not necessarily
mean that one or the other qubit is better suited for quantum computing because
gate times and fidelities need to be considered, too.

Different applications like Quantum sensing, Quantum computing and Quantum
communication are using different implementations of qubits to suit their
application.

The following is an incomplete list of physical implementations of qubits, and
the choices of basis are by convention only.
