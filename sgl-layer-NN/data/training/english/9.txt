Magic: The Gathering (colloquially known as Magic or MTG) is a tabletop and
digital collectable card game created by Richard Garfield.[1] Released in 1993
by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro), Magic was the first
trading card game and had approximately thirty-five million players as of
December 2018,[2][3][4] and over twenty billion Magic cards were produced in
the period from 2008 to 2016, during which time it grew in popularity.[5][6]

A player in Magic takes the role of a Planeswalker, a powerful wizard who can
travel ("walk") between dimensions ("planes") of the Multiverse, doing battle
with other players as Planeswalkers by casting spells, using artifacts, and
summoning creatures as depicted on individual cards drawn from their individual
decks. A player defeats their opponent typically (but not always) by casting
spells and attacking with creatures to deal damage to the opponent's "life
total", with the objective being to reduce it from 20 to 0, or 40 to 0 in some
group formats. Although the original concept of the game drew heavily from the
motifs of traditional fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons,
the gameplay bears little similarity to paper-and-pencil games, while
simultaneously having substantially more cards and more complex rules than many
other card games.

Magic can be played by two or more players, either in person
with printed cards or on a computer, smartphone or tablet with virtual cards
through the Internet-based software
