In particle physics and physical cosmology, Planck units are a set of units of
measurement defined exclusively in terms of four universal physical constants,
in such a manner that these physical constants take on the numerical value of 1
when expressed in terms of these units. Originally proposed in 1899 by German
physicist Max Planck, these units are a system of natural units because their
definition is based on properties of nature, more specifically the properties
of free space, rather than a choice of prototype object. They are relevant in
research on unified theories such as quantum gravity.

The term Planck scale refers to quantities of space, time, energy and other
units that are similar in magnitude to corresponding Planck units. This region
may be characterized by particle energies of around 1019 GeV or 109 J, time
intervals of around 10−43 s and lengths of around 10−35 m (approximately the
energy-equivalent of the Planck mass, the Planck time and the Planck length,
respectively). At the Planck scale, the predictions of the Standard Model,
quantum field theory and general relativity are not expected to apply, and
quantum effects of gravity are expected to dominate. The best-known example is
represented by the conditions in the first 10−43 seconds of our universe after
the Big Bang, approximately 13.8 billion years ago.

The four universal constants that, by definition, have a numeric value 1 when
expressed in these units are:

the speed of light in vacuum, c, the gravitational constant, G, the reduced
Planck constant, ħ, and the Boltzmann constant, kB.
